# Filter Component Test Plan

## Objective
To verify that the Filter component functions correctly, with a focus on ensuring that the layout shift issue has been resolved and that all filter types work as expected.

## Test Cases

### 1. Layout Stability
1.1. Verify that the filter sections maintain consistent height and alignment when no filters are active.
1.2. Apply a filter and check that the 'x' button appears without causing any layout shift.
1.3. Remove the filter and ensure the 'x' button disappears without affecting the layout.
1.4. Rapidly apply and remove filters to check for any unexpected layout changes.

### 2. Range Filter Functionality
2.1. Verify that the range slider accurately reflects the current filter range.
2.2. Test minimum and maximum value inputs to ensure they update the slider correctly.
2.3. Check that the filter is applied correctly when using the slider.
2.4. Verify that the filter is applied correctly when manually entering values.
2.5. Test edge cases (e.g., setting min equal to max, setting values outside the allowed range).

### 3. Business Type Filter Functionality
3.1. Verify that all business types are displayed in the dropdown.
3.2. Check that selecting a business type correctly filters the data.
3.3. Ensure that the "All" option resets the filter.

### 4. Reset Functionality
4.1. Apply multiple filters and verify that the "Reset All Filters" button clears all active filters.
4.2. Check that individual 'x' buttons correctly reset their respective filters.

### 5. Context Integration
5.1. Verify that changes in the Filter component correctly update the DashboardContext.
5.2. Ensure that the Filter component accurately reflects the initial state from the DashboardContext.

### 6. Performance
6.1. Test the Filter component with a large number of data points to ensure smooth performance.
6.2. Verify that rapid filter changes don't cause noticeable lag or performance issues.

### 7. Accessibility
7.1. Check that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
7.2. Verify that screen readers can properly interpret and announce filter states and changes.
7.3. Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements.

## Manual Testing Procedure
1. Load the application in various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
2. Follow each test case, interacting with the Filter component as a user would.
3. Pay close attention to any layout shifts, unexpected behaviors, or performance issues.
4. Document any bugs or inconsistencies found during testing.

## Automated Testing
Implement Jest and React Testing Library tests to cover:
- Rendering of the Filter component with various prop combinations.
- Interaction with range sliders and dropdown selects.
- Integration with DashboardContext.

## Reporting
After completing the tests, compile a report detailing:
- Test results for each case (Pass/Fail)
- Any bugs or issues discovered
- Screenshots or recordings of any problematic behaviors
- Recommendations for fixes or improvements

This test plan will help ensure comprehensive coverage of the Filter component's functionality and verify that the layout shift issue has been successfully resolved.
