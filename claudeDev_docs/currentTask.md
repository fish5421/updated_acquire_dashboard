# Current Task: Dashboard Testing and Optimization

## Completed Improvements
1. Implemented centralized state management using React Context (DashboardContext).
2. Moved filter logic from individual components to the context, improving separation of concerns.
3. Removed prop drilling by using the context in both the Dashboard and Filter components.
4. Updated the Filter component to calculate business types internally, reducing the responsibilities of the Dashboard component.
5. Ensured that the DashboardProvider wraps the entire application in App.jsx, making the context available throughout the app.
6. Added filterRanges to the DashboardContext to manage the actual ranges of data.
7. Implemented updateFilterRanges function in the Dashboard component to update filter ranges when new data is loaded.
8. Modified the Filter component to use filterRanges from the context, ensuring filter sliders adjust to the actual data ranges.
9. Enhanced StartupDetailsTable component:
   - Improved visual hierarchy and readability by adjusting column widths and alignment.
   - Enhanced the "Actions" column by replacing the text "Remove" with a more intuitive trash icon button.
   - Added alternating row colors to improve readability and scannability.
   - Implemented right-alignment for numeric data columns for better readability.
   - Updated styling using Tailwind CSS classes for consistent and maintainable design.
10. Implemented sorting functionality for all columns in the StartupDetailsTable, including 'price to revenue' and 'price-to-profit' columns:
    - Added onClick handlers to all column headers for sorting.
    - Implemented visual indicators (arrows) to show the current sort column and direction.
    - Updated the sortData function to handle sorting for calculated columns ('price to revenue' and 'price-to-profit').
    - Ensured correct sorting for numeric and string values.
11. Fixed sorting issue for "TTM Revenue" and "Asking Price" columns.
12. Updated sorting for "TTM Profit" column:
    - Updated parseNumericValue function to handle negative values correctly.
    - Added debug logging for the "TTM Profit" column sorting process.
13. Fixed layout shift issue in the Filter component:
    - Modified the ActiveFilterIndicator to always take up space, preventing layout shifts when the 'x' button appears or disappears.
    - Adjusted the layout of filter headers to accommodate the new ActiveFilterIndicator design.
    - Ensured consistent height and alignment for all filter sections.

## Current Focus
Comprehensive testing of recent changes and implementing performance optimizations.

## Next Steps
1. Conduct thorough testing of the Filter component:
   - Verify that the layout shift issue has been fully resolved for all filter types.
   - Test the appearance and disappearance of the 'x' button for active filters.
   - Ensure consistent spacing and alignment across all filter sections.

2. Verify sorting functionality in the StartupDetailsTable:
   - Test sorting for all columns, including "TTM Profit", "TTM Revenue", and "Asking Price".
   - Confirm correct handling of negative values in numeric sorting.
   - Check that visual indicators (arrows) accurately reflect the current sort column and direction.

3. Update and expand unit tests:
   - Add tests for the new layout behavior of the Filter component.
   - Enhance tests for the sorting functionality in StartupDetailsTable, covering all edge cases.
   - Ensure all recent changes are properly covered by unit tests.

4. Implement performance optimizations:
   - Add pagination to the StartupDetailsTable to improve performance with large datasets.
   - Investigate and implement memoization for expensive calculations or components.
   - Profile the application to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.

5. Enhance accessibility:
   - Review and update ARIA attributes in the Filter and StartupDetailsTable components.
   - Ensure proper keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
   - Test the application with screen readers and make necessary adjustments.

6. Document recent changes and update user guide:
   - Update the project documentation to reflect recent changes and new features.
   - Create or update user guidelines for the new filter behavior and sorting functionality.

## Benefits of Recent Changes
- Improved user experience with consistent layout in the Filter component.
- Enhanced sorting functionality with better handling of various data types.
- Increased code maintainability and readability.

## Future Considerations
- Implement data caching mechanisms for improved performance with large datasets.
- Explore advanced filtering options, such as multi-select filters or date range filters.
- Consider adding data visualization features, such as customizable charts or graphs.
- Investigate the possibility of user-customizable dashboards with saveable configurations.
- Explore options for exporting filtered and sorted data in various formats (CSV, PDF, etc.).
