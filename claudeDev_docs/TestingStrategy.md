# Testing Strategy for Startup Dashboard Application

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for our Startup Dashboard application. We will implement a comprehensive testing approach, covering unit tests, component tests, and integration tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of our application.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
Focus on testing individual functions and methods in isolation.

### Component Tests
Test individual React components to ensure they render correctly and behave as expected.

### Integration Tests
Test the interaction between multiple components and the overall functionality of the application.

## Testing Tools
- Jest: Test runner and assertion library
- React Testing Library: For rendering and interacting with React components in tests

## Test Coverage Goals
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage across the entire application
- 100% coverage for critical business logic and data processing functions

- [ ] Test navigation functionality

### 10. FileManagement
- [ ] Test file listing functionality
- [ ] Verify file deletion (if implemented)

### 11. Utils (in src/lib/utils.ts)
- [ ] Unit tests for all utility functions

## Next Steps
1. Implement RangeFilter tests
2. Review and update existing tests if necessary
3. Proceed with Sidebar tests

## Continuous Integration
- Set up GitHub Actions or another CI tool to run tests automatically on each pull request
- Enforce passing tests before allowing merges to the main branch

## Maintenance
- Regularly review and update tests as new features are added or existing ones are modified
- Conduct periodic test coverage analysis and improve coverage where needed

This testing strategy will be updated as the project evolves and new testing requirements are identified.
